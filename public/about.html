<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I'm Rohan, a Business Intelligence Engineer (BIE) at Amazon with a
  passion for software development. Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by
  diving into the world of web development. This website is a part of my
  learning journey where I get to experiment with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  When I'm not analyzing data or developing new software solutions, I enjoy
  exploring new technologies and working on creative projects that challenge my
  problem-solving skills. Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you enjoy
  what you see!.
